# C99 Math

- Source code: [](/dir/s2/mod/math?ci=trunk)
- Test/demo code: [](/finfo/s2/mod/math/test.s2)

This loadable module implements a variety of C99-specified math
functions. See the test script for the full list of functions (most of
which i have no clue how to actually use - math is *really not my
thing*).

Now that cwal/s2 are (since summer 2021) C99, these functions
"could" be moved into the base numeric prototypes or a new hypothetical
Math object in the s2 core. So far they've never been needed, though.
