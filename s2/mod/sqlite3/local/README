To use a local copy of sqlite3.[ch] for the s2 sqlite3 module, simply
place sqlite3.[ch] in this directory. The build process will see it
and use it instead of the system-wide library.

FWIW, this approach is highly recommended over using the system-level
library, as those are often sorely out of date, especially on
*cough*RedHat*cough* systems used by many web hosters.

We do not include copies of sqlite3.[ch] in this source repo only
because they're so huge :/.
