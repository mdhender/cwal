The files regex.[ch], utf.[ch], and utftype.c were taken from the MuJS
project (https://github.com/ccxvii/mujs) on 2018-11-24. They have been
modified from their original form only to eliminate a couple minor
compiler warnings (extra commas in enum declarations and one unused
function parameter).

What follows is the MuJS license. Though it does not explicitly say
so, it is the ISC license (https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC), which
is functionally equivalent to the MIT and simplified BSD licenses.
